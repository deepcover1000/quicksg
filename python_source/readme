1. This folder contains the current python source code that was used to create the .c file. Cython3 was used to generate this file.
  i.e. cython3 --embed -o quicksg.c quicksg.py

2. Subsequently gcc was used to compile the executable that was then packaged. The compilation of the python ==> .c 
  i.e. gcc -Os -I /usr/include/python3.5 -o quicksg quicksg.c -lpython3.5m -lpthread -lm -lutil -ldl
  
3. Once the package creation requirements were in place ( folders etc ) the package was generated from the compiled .c
  i.e. sudo dpkg-deb --build ~/projects/quicksg/quicksg --all
  
4. The packaged application was then installed via dpkg
  i.e. sudo dpkg -i quicksg.deb
  
  You need to ensure that you have build--essential, python dev versions and all that good stuff installed on your machine 
  before running any of the above.
